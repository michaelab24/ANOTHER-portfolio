                    <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. I appreciate you stopping by, but before you go any further you should know a couple of things about me! I'm originally from the St. Louis area but I moved to Nashville to go to Belmont. I graduated in 2018 with a degree in business with an emphasis on the music business. Since that time I've done some odds and ends jobs and am currently working as an Amazon Delivery Driver, and I haven't looked back since! A couple of months ago I decided to give myself a new challenge and enrolled in the Vanderbilt Coding Bootcamp. I hope my portfolio excites you but I am still very much a beginner in this crazy world of coding, so with that in mind please enjoy and know that I'm working to get better every day!</p>
